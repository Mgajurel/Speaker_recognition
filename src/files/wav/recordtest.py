## recordtest.py
##
## This is an example of a simple sound capture script.
##
## The script opens an ALSA pcm device for sound capture, sets
## various attributes of the capture, and reads in a loop,
## writing the data to standard out.
##
## To test it out do the following:
## python recordtest.py out.raw # talk to the microphone
## aplay -r 8000 -f S16_LE -c 1 out.raw
